**Disaster Recovery Policy**  
**BlueWave Compliance**  

### 1. Introduction  
The **Disaster Recovery Policy (DRP)** of **BlueWave Compliance** outlines the procedures for responding to and recovering from disruptive events, ensuring business continuity and data protection.

### 2. Scope  
This policy applies to all **IT infrastructure, cloud services, databases, applications, and personnel** responsible for managing company systems. It covers **natural disasters, cyber-attacks, hardware failures, data breaches, and operational disruptions**.

### 3. Objectives  
- Ensure **rapid recovery** of critical systems and services.
- Minimize data loss and downtime.
- Maintain regulatory compliance with **ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and CCPA**.
- Establish clear roles and responsibilities for disaster recovery.

### 4. Disaster Classification  
Disasters are categorized into three levels:
- **Level 1 (Minor Disruption)**: Partial service outage, quickly recoverable with minimal impact.
- **Level 2 (Major Incident)**: System-wide failure requiring significant restoration efforts.
- **Level 3 (Critical Disaster)**: Total infrastructure failure requiring full-scale disaster recovery activation.

### 5. Disaster Recovery Team (DRT)  
The **Disaster Recovery Team (DRT)** is responsible for implementing recovery strategies. The team includes:
- **Disaster Recovery Manager**: Oversees recovery operations and communication.
- **IT & DevOps Engineers**: Restore infrastructure and applications.
- **Security & Compliance Officers**: Ensure adherence to legal and security requirements.
- **Support Team**: Communicate with stakeholders and customers.

### 6. Disaster Recovery Procedures  
#### 6.1 Backup Strategy  
- **Data Backups**: Performed daily and stored in secure, geographically separate locations.
- **Application Backups**: Regular snapshots of critical applications for fast restoration.
- **Cloud Storage**: Redundant storage for disaster resilience.

#### 6.2 Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) & Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)  
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Maximum downtime acceptable before full restoration (**4 hours** for critical systems, **24 hours** for non-critical systems).
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum allowable data loss (**1 hour for critical data**, **12 hours for non-critical data**).

#### 6.3 Failover & Redundancy  
- **Auto-Failover Systems**: Redundant infrastructure to switch to backup resources.
- **High Availability (HA)**: Cloud-based replication for key services.
- **Load Balancing**: Ensuring continuous availability of services.

#### 6.4 Incident Response & Activation  
- The **DRT assesses the situation** and determines the necessary recovery actions.
- Recovery procedures are initiated based on disaster severity.
- If required, customers and regulatory bodies are notified.

#### 6.5 System Restoration  
- **Infrastructure Recovery**: Servers, networks, and cloud services are restored.
- **Database Restoration**: Backup data is validated and restored to production.
- **Application Recovery**: Services are tested for full functionality before relaunch.

### 7. Testing & Maintenance  
- **Annual Disaster Recovery Drills**: Simulations are conducted to test response effectiveness.
- **System Reviews**: Backup integrity is validated regularly.
- **Policy Updates**: DRP is reviewed and updated based on evolving risks.

### 8. Compliance & Reporting  
- Disaster recovery processes align with **SOC 2, ISO 27001, and industry standards**.
- Documentation is maintained for audits and regulatory reporting.
