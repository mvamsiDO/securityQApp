**BlueWave Compliance**   

### 1. Introduction  
At **BlueWave Compliance**, we are committed to ensuring the security and confidentiality of customer and company data. This **Information Security Policy** establishes the principles, responsibilities, and controls that protect our systems, infrastructure, and information assets from security threats.

### 2. Scope  
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and any third parties accessing BlueWave Compliance systems or handling company data. It covers all computing resources, applications, networks, and data storage solutions used in our operations.

### 3. Security Principles  
To safeguard data integrity, confidentiality, and availability, we adhere to the following security principles:
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and systems only receive the minimum access required to perform their functions.
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls mitigate potential risks.
- **Zero Trust Model**: Verification is required for all access attempts, regardless of source.
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

### 4. Access Control  
#### 4.1 User Authentication  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all system access.
- Unique user accounts are assigned to all personnel; shared accounts are prohibited.
- Strong password policies enforce complexity and periodic resets.

#### 4.2 Role-Based Access  
- Access to sensitive systems is based on job roles and reviewed regularly.
- Privileged accounts are monitored and require additional approval.

### 5. Data Protection  
#### 5.1 Data Classification  
All data is classified into categories such as **Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted** to determine appropriate protection levels.

#### 5.2 Data Handling and Storage  
- Confidential and restricted data must be stored in encrypted databases.
- External storage devices and cloud solutions require approval for use.
- Data is regularly backed up, with backups stored in a secure, geographically separate location.

### 6. Network Security  
- Firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) are implemented to monitor and control traffic.
- VPNs are required for remote access to company systems.
- Network segmentation is used to isolate critical systems from less secure environments.

### 7. Security Monitoring and Incident Response  
#### 7.1 Logging and Monitoring  
- All system access, changes, and security events are logged and reviewed.
- Automated threat detection and anomaly monitoring systems are in place.

#### 7.2 Incident Response Plan  
- A dedicated incident response team (IRT) is responsible for handling security incidents.
- All security breaches must be reported immediately.
- Post-incident reviews and forensic analysis are conducted for continuous improvement.

### 8. Vendor and Third-Party Security  
- Vendors must comply with our security standards and undergo periodic security assessments.
- Third-party integrations are reviewed for security risks before implementation.

### 9. Employee Security Awareness  
- Security training is mandatory for all employees upon onboarding and annually thereafter.

### 11. Enforcement
