What Are Cookies? 
Cookies are small text files that may be placed on your device when you interact with online services and access certain websites. Cookies do not recognize you personally, but rather the device you use or capture your preferences. Cookies can be used to remember information about your visit such as language settings or track when you last logged in to help improve your experience with a website. They can also be used to provide certain features or functionality or to 
troubleshoot errors, and provide insights into how services are being used. Similar technologies such as pixels, web beacons, tracking technologies, or local storage can also be used for these purposes. We use “cookies” in this Cookie Policy to refer to cookies and these similar technologies.
